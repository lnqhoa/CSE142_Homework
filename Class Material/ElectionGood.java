// A program to read in the number of votes each of two candidates received
//   in a number of precincts, then compute the winner of the election.
//
// This version of the program demonstrates good information flow by making
//   proper use of parameters and return values. Notice how main is a concise
//   summary of the program and major methods return their results to main.
//
// Notice also the factoring of common code out of the branches of the if/else
//   statement in printResults.
